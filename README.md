# .dotfiles

These files bootstrap my development setup.
The `bashrc` and `vimrc` files are portable on Linux and OSX.

### boostrap.sh

The `base.sh` file can be cat'd over SSH to a fresh server to setup the 
base system.  It installs docker, tmux, git, and that is about it.  This
base install is suitable for both servers and development setups.
